# Bayesian shrinkage

Functions to estimate linear regression models with various shrinkage priors. Supported priors are the Normal-Gamma, Dirichlet-Laplace, Horseshoe, and stochastic search variable selection. Plotting functions for posterior parameter densities are available.

See `0_main.R` for a demonstration using simulated data.
